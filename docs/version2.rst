Phenopacket version 2
=====================

Version 1 of phenopackets was approved by GA4GH in `October, 2019 <https://www.ga4gh.org/news/phenopackets-standardizing-and-exchanging-patient-phenotypic-data/>`_.
Based on initial experiences and feedback from multiple sources, we are planning to
extend version 1 to include better representation of the time course of disease, treatment,
and cancer-related data. Discussions are planned in the GA4GH
Clin/Pheno Full WS & Phenopackets Subgroups. Newcomers are welcome, please contact
the `GA4GH <https://www.ga4gh.org/contactus/>`_ to get involved!

A number of new elements are now open for discussion by the community in the
`v1.1 branch <https://github.com/phenopackets/phenopacket-schema/tree/v1.1>`_ of
the phenopackets GitHub repository.

We anticipate that version 2.0 will contain a very few breaking (backwards-incompatible)
changes affecting the representation of time and dates. These changes will be brought to the
GA4GH steering committee before release.
