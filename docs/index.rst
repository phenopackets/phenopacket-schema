Welcome to the documentation for the phenopacket-schema!
#####################################################

The goal of the phenopacket-schema is to define the phenotypic description of a patient/sample in the context
of rare disease, common/complex disease, or cancer. The schema as well as source code in Java, C++, and Python
is available from the `phenopacket-schema GitHub repository <https://github.com/phenopackets/phenopacket-schema>`_.

Version 1 of phenopackets was approved by GA4GH in `October, 2019 <https://www.ga4gh.org/news/phenopackets-standardizing-and-exchanging-patient-phenotypic-data/>`_.
Based on initial experiences and feedback from multiple sources, and discussions in the GA4GH
Clin/Pheno Workstream and Phenopackets Subgroups, version 1 has been
extended to include better representation of the time course of disease, treatment,
and cancer-related data.  The current document refers to the version 2 of the Phenopackets schema.
Version 2 is currently being finalized by the
`Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) <https://www.ga4gh.org/>`_ Clinical & Phenotypic Data Capture workstream.

To see the documentation for version 1, which was approved by GA4GH in 2019,
