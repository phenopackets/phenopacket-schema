A terminology is a set of prefered or official terms in a domain. One of the  most important terminologies for information
retrieval in the medical domain is the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), which is used for indexing and
searching PubMed.

Ontologies differ from terminologies in that ontologies define relationships between concepts
in a way that allows computational logical reasoning. A short introduction is available
in this recent `review <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30304648>`_.

The phenopacket schema requires the use of a common ontology, a logically defined hierarchy of terms, that allows
sophisticated algorithmic analysis over medically relevant abnormalities.
The `National Cancer institute's Thesaurus (NCIt) <http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/ncit.html>`_ is used for
cancer biosamples, and is the de facto standard for cancer knowledge representation and regulatory submission.
The `Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) <http://www.human-phenotype-ontology.org>`_  was built for genomic diagnostics,
translational research, genomic matchmaking, and systems biology applications in the field of rare disease and other
fields of medicine.
The HPO is developed in the context of
the `Monarch Initiative <https://monarchinitiative.org/>`_, an international team of
computer scientists, clinicians, and biologists in the United States, Europe, and Australia;
HPO is being translated into multiple languages to support international interoperability.
Due to its extensive phenotypic coverage beyond other terminologies, HPO has recently been integrated
into the `Unified Medical Language System <https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/current/HPO/>`_ (UMLS) to support deep phenotyping in a variety of mainstream health care IT systems.
